Hair loss commonly referred to as alopecia or baldness, is hair loss on one’s head or body. At the very least, the head is usually engaged. Hair loss can range in intensity from a tiny patch to the full body. Hair Treatment with Homeopathy is natural and free of adverse effects. As part of this cycle, it is normal to shed some hair each day. Some people, however, may have significant (abnormal) hair loss. This form of hair loss can affect both men and women, and youngsters.
